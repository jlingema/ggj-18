# Global Game Jam 2018

This is an experiment that uses the fantasy console Pico-8.

## Requirements

- [Pico8tool](https://github.com/dansanderson/picotool)
- Python 3.6

## Building the project

Assuming you're using Windows, you can simply run the `build.bat`, which expects that the picotool was cloned to the directory above the project. If the build is successful, the script also copies the cartridge into the location that Pico-8 expects. Launch pico-8 and run the game by

```
LOAD GAME.P8.PNG
RUN
```
